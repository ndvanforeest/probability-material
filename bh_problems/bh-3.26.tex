\begin{exercise}[BH.3.26]
  If $X \sim \text{HGeom}(w, b, n)$, what is the distribution of $n - X$? Give a short proof.
\begin{solution}
	If $X\sim \text{HGeom}(w,b,n)$, then 
    \begin{align*}
    	P(X=k) = \frac{{w \choose k}{b \choose n-k}}{{w+b \choose n}}.
    \end{align*}
    For $n-X$, we have
    \begin{align*}
    	P(n-X=k) & = P(X=n-k)\\
    	& =   \frac{{w \choose n-k}{b \choose k}}{{w+b \choose n}}.
    \end{align*}
    We see that $X\sim\text{Hgeom}(b,w,n)$.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
	\textbf{[BH.28]} There are $n$ eggs, each of which hatches a chick with probability $p$ (independently). Each of these chicks survives with probability $r$, independently. What is the distribution of the number of chicks that hatch? What is the distribution of the number of chicks that survive? (Give the PMFs; also give the names of the distributions and their parameters, if applicable.)
\begin{solution}
	The probability of the number of chicks that hatch $H$ is binomial with parameters $n$ and $p$ ($H\sim \text{Bin}(n,p)$). Each chicken has probability $pr$ of hatching a chick that survives, so the number of surviving chicks is also binomial, now with parameters $n$ and $pr$.
\end{solution}
